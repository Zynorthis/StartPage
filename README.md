# StartPage
My personal startpage.

# Setup
The Tools I use include:
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=us) With [Oh My Posh](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ohmyposh/XP8K0HKJFRXGCK) installed
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) Package Manager

After cloning this repository, open the project using an IDE of your choice. The recommended IDE I use is [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for web development projects such as this. The code for startpage can be found in the `startpage/src/` folder.

Open [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=us) and navigate to `startpage` folder. If you don't use Windows Terminal, you can do the same in Powershell. 

Run ```yarn install``` to install all of the project dependancies, followed by ```yarn start``` to start the startpage on localhost:3000. You can now see the startpage running in your browser if you navigate to http://localhost:3000/. Anytime you make a change to a file within the `/src/` folder and save the file, the changes will take effect immediately and show in the browser.
